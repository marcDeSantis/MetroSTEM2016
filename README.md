###FountainJS fixes:
1. `npm install -g gulp-cli`
2. `npm install --save babel-plugin-istanbul`

###Challenges:
1. Create a web app with FountainJS using UI-Router. These are the settings you will need at the prompts:

  ```
? Which JavaScript framework do you want? Angular 1
? Which module management do you want? None with Bower and script injection
? Which JS preprocessor do you want? ES2015 today with Babel
? Which CSS preprocessor do you want? Less
? Which Continuous Integration platform do you want? (Press <space> to select, <a> to toggle all, <i> to inverse selection)
? Do you want a sample app? Just a Hello World
? Would you like a router? Angular UI Router
  ```
2. Add a Navigation bar to your app and make it work with a few working links. If you need a hint on how to add the NavBar, you can look back on [this lesson](https://github.com/marcDeSantis/MetroSTEM2016/blob/master/AngularFountainJS.md)
3. Try adding a login page and get some user authentication working! You will need to build a simple authorization service in AngularJS (you can hardcode the username and password validation for now). You can use the pattern in [this article](https://medium.com/@mattlanham/authentication-with-angularjs-4e927af3a15f#.kychnt1ah) to understand how to enforce a user is authorized using Angular UI router. Read about AngularJS services [here](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/services)

###Getting Started:

1. Take the AngularJS course on [Code School](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/shaping-up-with-angular-js)
2. Follow [these instructions](https://github.com/marcDeSantis/MetroSTEM2016/blob/master/AngularFountainJS.md) for replicating the front end lesson that we walked through in class
3. [Register](http://github.com/join) for a GitHub account, create a repository and walk through this [Hello World tutorial](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)
